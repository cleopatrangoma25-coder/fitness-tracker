- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Live staging environment
- ✅ Full shadcn/ui integration

## 📈 **Success Metrics**

- ✅ 100% TypeScript coverage
- ✅ Successful builds and deployment
- ✅ Modern, responsive UI
- ❌ Test coverage (needs implementation)
- ❌ ESLint passing (needs fixing)

---

**Bottom Line**: The project has a solid foundation with most core technologies working. The main gaps are in tRPC integration and testing, which are critical for production readiness. With focused effort on these areas, the application will be fully aligned with the promised tech stack.

**Note**: Firebase Functions have been removed from the project. The application now uses Express.js with REST API endpoints instead of Firebase Functions.
