- [x] Set up PNPM workspaces
- [x] Integrate Turborepo for build orchestration and caching
- [x] Create the initial directory structure (apps/mobile, functions/, packages/*)

### [x] Tooling & Code Quality
- [x] Configure a strict root tsconfig.json and extend it in each package
- [x] Set up ESLint with TypeScript rules and integrate it with Turborepo
- [x] Configure Prettier for consistent code formatting
- [x] Implement Husky and lint-staged for pre-commit hooks (linting, formatting)

### [x] Firebase & Backend Setup
- [x] Create fitness-tracker-dev and fitness-tracker-prod projects in Firebase
- [x] Set up Firebase emulators for local development (Auth, Firestore)

- [x] Implement the custom deployment script (prepare-deploy.js) to handle monorepo dependencies

### [x] Frontend & UI Setup
- [x] Initialize the Next.js web application in apps/web
- [x] Set up Tailwind CSS for styling
- [x] Initialize Storybook in a ui package for isolated component development
